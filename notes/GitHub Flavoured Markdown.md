# GitHub Flavoured Markdown

* Footnotes
```markdown
> Have you considered publishing v1.0.0 as an [RFC](https://rfc-editor.org/)?
> 
> I can see two immediate benefits:
> 
> * The format would be easier to use / reference from other RFCs and by other standards efforts.
> * You could get `application/toml` [registered](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)[1](#user-content-fn-1-9b37a45a61c2609c590baf4bd050e0e7).
> 
> If you'd consider it, I'd be happy to help - you don't have to go through the full standards process, the independent stream would be very appropriate for this and comparatively lightweight.
> 
> ## Footnotes
> 1. You don't need an RFC for the full format to get the registration -- but it does require some sort of standards publication. [â†©](#user-content-fnref-1-9b37a45a61c2609c590baf4bd050e0e7)
