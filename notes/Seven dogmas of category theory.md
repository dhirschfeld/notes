# Seven dogmas of category theory

* https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/06/06/seven-dogmas-of-category-theory/


Joseph Goguen gave seven dogmas in his paper A Categorical Manifesto.

    1. To each species of mathematical structure, there corresponds a category whose
       objects have that structure, and whose morphisms preserve it.
    2. To any natural construction on structures of one species, yielding structures of
       another species, there corresponds a functor from the category of the first species
       to the category of the second.
    3. To each natural translation from a construction F : A -> B to a construction
       G: A -> B there corresponds a natural transformation F => G.
    4. A diagram D in a category C can be seen as a system of constraints, and then a limit
       of D represents all possible solutions of the system.
    5. To any canonical construction from one species of structure to another corresponds
       an adjuction between the corresponding categories.
    6. Given a species of structure, say widgets, then the result of interconnecting a
       system of widgets to form a super-widget corresponds to taking the colimit of the
       diagram of widgets in which the morphisms show how they are interconnected.
    7. Given a species of structure C, then a species of structure obtained by
       “decorating” or “enriching” that of C corresponds to a comma category under C
       (or under a functor from C).

Although category theory is all about general patterns, it can be hard to learn what the
general patterns of category theory are. The list above is the best high-level description
of category theory I’ve seen.
