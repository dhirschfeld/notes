# Cover Letter

To whom it may concern,
I'd like to apply for the position of Data Engineer as advertised on LinkedIn:
* https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2799453529/

The advert on LinkedIn describes it as a Brisbane based job which is ideal for me as I'm Brisbane based. It's described here as a Sydney job and, whilst I'm happy to work remotely, I'm not looking to move to Sydney.

If that's ok, I think my background and experience may be well suited to the role. My career has been analytics-based, but more and more it's has focussed on the low-level infrastructure and data aspects as it's pointless having sophisticated models if you feed them junk data.

Most recently I've been involved in setting up an automated machine-learning forecast for Stanwell's retail demand on Azure Kubernetes Service. A very large part of this has involved establishing, databases, designing schemas and data-lake storage and setting up event-driven, automated processing of data as it arrives. 90% of the work involved has been in establishing robust and rigorous data-transformation pipelines, and as such, I think I have a good grounding for the job of Data Engineer.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss further how I might be suitable for the role.

Kind Regards & Merry Xmas,
Dave Hirschfeld
